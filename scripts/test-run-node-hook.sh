# Fixture suite for .claude/hooks/run-node-hook.sh, the wrapper the three
# PreToolUse guards in .claude/settings.json run through. Ported from
# dork-labs/dorkos with the wrapper, minus the `--warn-only` rows.
#
# It exists because the failure it prevents was invisible from inside a working
# session. The guards used to be started with a bare `node`, node here is
# nvm-managed, and a hook that cannot start exits 127 — which the Claude Code
# hooks reference classifies as a NON-blocking error: the tool call proceeds.
# So on any machine whose launching environment lacked an nvm PATH, the guards
# enforced nothing at all, and nothing said so (dorkos DOR-2121).
#
# Every case below runs the real wrapper as a real process. The fail-closed
# cases are hermetic: PATH is emptied, HOME is pointed at a scratch dir, and
# DORKOS_HOOK_NODE_PATHS is set to the empty string, so the verdict cannot
# depend on whether this machine happens to have a Homebrew node. The
# resolution cases use fake `node` executables that print the path they were
# invoked as, which is the only way to prove WHICH candidate the wrapper chose
# rather than merely that it found one.
