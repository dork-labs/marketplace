#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Fixture suite for scripts/should-arm-automerge.sh, the gate that decides
# whether a pull request may have auto-merge armed on it.
#
# It exists because the failure this gate can produce is silent. A crash is
# obvious and harmless: nothing gets armed. The dangerous bug is a SKIP branch
# that quietly stops matching — a renamed field, a `bucket` value nobody
# anticipated, a `labels` payload shaped as strings instead of objects — because
# then the gate keeps returning ARM and the first symptom is unreviewed code on
# `main`. Nothing about the source makes that visible, so every refusal is pinned
# here by shape.
#
# Ported from dork-labs/dorkos (scripts/test-should-arm-automerge.sh) with the
# gate it tests. Keep the two gates' rules in step; the check names in the green
# fixture below are this repo's own.
#
#   bash scripts/test-should-arm-automerge.sh
#   GATE=/path/to/other.sh bash scripts/test-should-arm-automerge.sh
#
# GATE exists so a candidate rewrite can be run against the same fixtures.
