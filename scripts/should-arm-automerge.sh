# Decide whether one pull request may have auto-merge armed on it.
#
# The rules for arming auto-merge on a finished pull request, so a green,
# reviewed PR lands without a person pressing the button. Authors apply them by
# hand today (CLAUDE.md); a scheduled merge-tail workflow will run this script
# over every open PR once the dorkos-merge-tail GitHub App is set up here.
#
# Ported from dork-labs/dorkos (scripts/should-arm-automerge.sh), where the same
# gate has run since 2026-07; keep the two in step, including the hold labels,
# so a label means the same thing in both repos.
#
# It is a separate script with fixtures, rather than jq inline in a workflow,
# because this is the gate that decides to LAND CODE without a human in the loop.
# The failure that matters is not a crash, it is arming something that should not
# have been armed, which is invisible until it merges. Every SKIP branch is
# pinned by scripts/test-should-arm-automerge.sh.
#
# The rule is affirmative, not permissive: a PR is armed only when every signal
# is explicitly good. Anything unknown, unsettled, or unreadable is a SKIP. In
# particular an in-flight check is NOT treated as "probably fine" — arming on a
# pending suite would merge the PR the instant it went green, before anyone had
# seen what the last check said.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/should-arm-automerge.sh <pr.json>
#   gh pr view N --json ... | scripts/should-arm-automerge.sh -
#
# Prints exactly one line:
#   ARM               arm auto-merge on this PR
#   SKIP <reason>     leave it alone; <reason> is a stable machine-readable slug
#
# Exit status is 0 for a readable verdict and 2 only when the input itself could
# not be parsed, so a malformed payload can never be mistaken for a quiet ARM.
#
# Expected input (a superset is fine; unknown keys are ignored):
#   {
#     "number": 537,
#     "state": "OPEN",
#     "isDraft": false,
#     "mergeStateStatus": "BEHIND",
#     "autoMergeRequest": null,
#     "mergeQueueEntry": null,
#     "reviewDecision": "APPROVED",
#     "labels": [{"name": "hold"}],
#     "unresolvedThreads": 0,
#     "checks": [{"name": "typecheck", "bucket": "pass"}]
#   }
#
# `bucket` follows `gh pr checks --json bucket`: pass | fail | pending | skipping | cancel.
#
# `autoMergeRequest` and `mergeQueueEntry` are BOTH needed, and neither implies
# the other: a pull request sitting in the merge queue reports
# `autoMergeRequest: null`, so the first field alone cannot tell you the merge is
# already handled. `mergeQueueEntry` is GraphQL-only — `gh pr view --json` does
# not expose it, so a caller building this payload from `gh pr view` alone will
# silently omit it and get a more permissive gate than it thinks.
