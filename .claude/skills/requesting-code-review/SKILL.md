# Requesting Code Review

Dispatch a code-reviewer subagent to catch issues before they cascade. The reviewer gets precisely crafted context for evaluation — never your session's history. This keeps the reviewer focused on the work product, not your thought process, and preserves your own context for continued work.

**Core principle:** Review early, review often.

## When to Request Review

**Mandatory:**

- After each batch of related tasks in spec-driven development (`/flow:execute`) — holistic batch-level review, not per-task review
- After completing a major feature
- Before merge to main

**Optional but valuable:**

- When stuck (fresh perspective)
- Before refactoring (baseline check)
- After fixing a complex bug

## Lightweight Alternative

For quick self-review without dispatching a subagent, trace through recently modified functions yourself to verify correctness and completeness inline. Use the full code-reviewer subagent (below) for deeper, more rigorous review.

## How to Request

### 1. Get git SHAs

```bash
BASE_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD~1)  # or origin/main for full branch review
HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
```

### 2. Dispatch code-reviewer subagent

Use the Agent tool with `subagent_type: "code-reviewer"`. Supply the following context:

**Required context:**

- `{WHAT_WAS_IMPLEMENTED}` — What you just built
- `{PLAN_OR_REQUIREMENTS}` — What it should do (spec path, task description, or requirements)
- `{BASE_SHA}` — Starting commit
- `{HEAD_SHA}` — Ending commit
- `{DESCRIPTION}` — Brief summary of the changes

**Marketplace-specific review concerns to include:**

- `marketplace.json` ⇄ `dorkos.json` consistency, and a valid `plugin.json` per touched package
- `SKILL.md` frontmatter and manifests passing `tools/schema-check`
- Flow config schema regenerated (`config/config.schema.json`) when the Zod source changed
- No committed local config (`plugins/flow/config/config.json`, `*.local.json`) or secrets
- Nothing from private repos (prices, plan names, hostnames, private paths)
- TSDoc on exports in `plugins/flow/scripts/`

### 3. Act on feedback

- **Critical** — Fix immediately. Bugs, security issues, data loss risks.
- **Important** — Fix before proceeding. Architecture problems, missing tests, error handling gaps.
- **Minor** — Note for later. Code style, optimization opportunities.
- **Push back** if the reviewer is wrong — provide technical reasoning, show code or tests that prove correctness.

### 4. Clean up the review workspace

If you checked the branch out somewhere to review it — a worktree, a scratch
branch like `rv712` or `review-549`, a detached checkout of the PR head — delete
it once you have reported. Review checkouts are disposable by construction: they
duplicate a branch that already lives on origin, so nothing is lost.

```bash
/worktree:prune          # what would go, and why
/worktree:prune --fix    # remove it
```

Do it in the same turn you report the review. In the DorkOS app repo, review
checkouts were 47 of the 107 worktrees one cleanup sweep removed, the largest
single category, because this was the one workflow that never said to clean up
after itself. Nothing else will collect them for you, because a review leaves no
PR and no ticket behind for `/flow:done` to notice.

**Run it from the main checkout, not from inside the review worktree.** A
worktree you are standing in reports `current-worktree` and is deliberately never
removed, so running the sweep from inside the thing you are trying to delete
silently does nothing.

`/worktree:prune` refuses anything it cannot prove is safe, so use it rather than
deleting by hand — in particular it will not touch a checkout you left
uncommitted work in, including files that only `git status --ignored` can see.

## Example

```
[Just completed the batch of tasks adding project auto-complete to flow]

You: Batch complete — let me request a holistic review before the next batch.

BASE_SHA=$(git rev-parse origin/main)  # or the SHA where the batch started
HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)

[Dispatch code-reviewer subagent]
  WHAT_WAS_IMPLEMENTED: optional completeProject adapter verb and project auto-complete behind a config gate
  PLAN_OR_REQUIREMENTS: the Linear issue's acceptance criteria, Tasks 1-3
  BASE_SHA: a7981ec
  HEAD_SHA: 3df7661
  DESCRIPTION: Added completeProject to the adapter contract as an optional verb,
    a config flag in the Zod schema, and engine tests for gate on/off

[Subagent returns]:
  Strengths: Optional verb degrades cleanly, tests cover both gate states
  Issues:
    Critical: config.schema.json not regenerated after the Zod change (CI drift check will fail)
    Minor: Magic number (30) for the retry window — extract to constant
  Assessment: With fixes

You: [Run npm run generate:schema, commit the result, extract constant]
[Continue to the next batch]
```

## Integration with Workflows

**Spec-Driven Development (`/flow:execute`):**

- Review holistically after each batch of related tasks — one review covering the whole batch beats per-task reviews
- Catch manifest drift and architecture drift early
- Fix before moving to the next batch

**Feature Development:**

- Review after completing the feature
- Verify against the spec before calling it done

**Ad-Hoc Development:**

- Review before merge to main
- Review when stuck for a fresh perspective

## Review Checklist (Marketplace-Specific)

The code-reviewer subagent should evaluate against these project standards:

**Catalog and manifests:**

- Every plugin in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` has a matching `.claude-plugin/dorkos.json` entry, and vice versa
- Each `source` path exists and holds a valid `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` with a matching `name`
- `claude plugin validate .` and `claude plugin validate ./plugins/<name>` are clean
- `tools/schema-check` (`npm run check`) passes for `SKILL.md` frontmatter and manifests

**Flow plugin (`plugins/flow`):**

- Tracker I/O goes through the adapter contract, not direct API calls from engine code
- Runtime `scripts/*.ts` import only runtime `dependencies` (adopters install with `--omit=dev`)
- Zod config schema changes ship with a regenerated `config/config.schema.json`
- `config/config.json` and `*.local.json` stay uncommitted; only `*.example.json` templates change
- TSDoc on all exported functions and classes

**Testing:**

- Flow tests in `plugins/flow/engine-tests/`, exercising real modules
- `npm test`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run format:check` pass in each touched package
- No implementation detail testing, no arbitrary timeouts

**Public repo:**

- Nothing from private repos (prices, plan names, hostnames, private paths)

## Red Flags

**Never:**

- Skip review because "it's simple"
- Ignore Critical issues
- Proceed with unfixed Important issues
- Argue with valid technical feedback

**If reviewer is wrong:**

- Push back with technical reasoning
- Show code or tests that prove correctness
- Request clarification on the concern
