#!/usr/bin/env bash
# watch-prs.sh — watch pull requests to merge completion, reporting state
# TRANSITIONS (never once-per-PR "seen" dedup: a PR that fails, recovers,
# and fails again reports every turn).
#
# Usage:
#   watch-prs.sh [--interval SECONDS] [--max-cycles N] [--once] PR [PR...]
#   watch-prs.sh --classify        # test seam: JSON snapshot on stdin -> event token
#   watch-prs.sh --probe PR        # test seam: run the real collection path for
#                                  # one PR (gh pr checks + the GraphQL query) and
#                                  # print its classify() input JSON. Read-only —
#                                  # same network calls the watch loop makes, no
#                                  # state kept, nothing mutated. Takes EXACTLY
#                                  # one PR; a missing or extra argument is a
#                                  # usage error, not a silent first-wins pick.
#                                  # Exits non-zero when the snapshot is ERR.
#
# One line per state TRANSITION on stdout (pipe into the Monitor tool or a
# notification hook). Silence means "same state as last cycle", so pair it
# with --max-cycles / a timeout that ANNOUNCES expiry — silence is never
# success. Exits 0 when every watched PR is MERGED or CLOSED.
#
# Event vocabulary (stable; the fixture test pins it):
#   MERGED                     terminal, the good end
#   CLOSED                     terminal, closed without merging
#   CONFLICTING                needs a rebase; a conflicting PR gets NO CI and
#                              NO automated review, so after the rebase re-arm
#                              auto-merge AND add the re-review label
#   FAILING(name,...)          required-check failures (standing Vercel reds
#                              excluded); a rerun of a pull_request job reuses
#                              the ORIGINAL merge snapshot, so if main has
#                              moved since, push an empty commit instead of
#                              rerunning; a check red on main's last commits
#                              too is a standing condition, not yours
#   EJECTED(reason)            the merge queue silently dropped the PR; nothing
#                              else reports this (no webhook, no check goes red)
#   STUCK_UNMERGEABLE          in the queue with entry state UNMERGEABLE — a
#                              dead entry that will never merge; clear it with
#                              the dequeuePullRequest mutation, then re-arm
#                              auto-merge (remediation in SKILL.md)
#   STALLED_IN_QUEUE           queued but zero checks reported for a while —
#                              the classic missing `on: merge_group` trigger
#   UNRESOLVED_THREADS(n)      open review threads (not outdated) — these block
#                              merge-tail from arming while everything is green
#   UNARMED_CLEAN              green and mergeable but nothing will merge it:
#                              arming auto-merge 422s on an already-clean PR
#                              ("Pull request is in clean status") — merge it
#                              directly: gh pr merge <n>
#   QUEUED(pos)                entered the merge queue (informational)
#   PENDING                    checks running / mergeability being computed;
#                              UNKNOWN mergeStateStatus is retry-not-terminal
#   RECOVERED                  was FAILING/CONFLICTING last cycle, healthy now

  # fallback and wiped the collected names EXACTLY when checks failed —
  # FAILING could never be reported (DOR-1630). Fix: collect stdout first, in
  # its own command substitution, decide from that — never from `gh`'s exit
  # code alone.

  # Empty stdout is NOT automatically a dead call: a PR with zero checks
  # configured also prints nothing, and `gh` still exits 0, 1, or 8 for that

  # limit). Reporting that as a healthy zero-check PR would read as PENDING
