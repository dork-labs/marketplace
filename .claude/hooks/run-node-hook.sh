#!/bin/bash
# run-node-hook.sh — run a Node-based .claude hook with an EXPLICITLY resolved
# node, and fail CLOSED for the guards when there is none.
#
# Ported from dork-labs/dorkos (.claude/hooks/run-node-hook.sh), minus its
# `--warn-only` mode, which only a hook this repo does not have used. Keep the
# node resolution in step with the original.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# The three PreToolUse guards (git-guard, process-guard, merge-guard) refuse
# the stash and pathspec-checkout commands, the kill-by-name commands, and admin
# merges, in code, because prose did not hold. settings.json used to start each
# of them with a bare `node`, and `#!/usr/bin/env node` on the .mjs files is the
# same PATH lookup, not a second chance.
#
# On a machine where node is nvm-managed, node is NOT on a stripped PATH:
#   $ env -i /bin/sh -c 'command -v node'        -> nothing
#   $ env -i /bin/sh -c '/usr/bin/env node -v'   -> not found
# Hooks inherit the environment of the process that launched Claude Code, so
# whenever that environment has no nvm-initialised PATH (a launchd/LaunchAgent
# start, a desktop-app launch, a stripped-env CI shell), the guard command
# exits 127 instead of running.
#
# 127 is not a block. From the Claude Code hooks reference, "Exit code output":
# exit 2 is the blocking error, and "Any other exit code doesn't block on its
# own for most hook events" — a hook that cannot start "lands in the same
# non-blocking bucket ... the action proceeds". So a missing node did not make
# the guards noisy, it made them absent: the commands they exist to refuse ran,
# silently unguarded (dorkos DOR-2121).
#
# A safety control must not be wagered on a PATH lookup. This wrapper resolves
# node itself and, when it cannot, refuses the tool call with an explanation
# rather than letting it through.
#
# USAGE
#   .claude/hooks/run-node-hook.sh <script.mjs> [args...]
#
# It FAILS CLOSED: no node, no runnable script, no argument at all -> exit 2
# with a one-line reason on stderr, because every way of getting this wrong
# should end with the guard on rather than off.
#
# HOW NODE IS RESOLVED, in order, first hit wins:
#   1. node in an ABSOLUTE directory on PATH   (the normal case; PATH is fine)
#   2. $NVM_BIN/node                           (an nvm shell that exported it)
#   3. highest ~/.nvm/versions/node/*/bin/node (nvm installed, PATH stripped)
#   4. /opt/homebrew/bin/node                  (Homebrew, Apple Silicon)
#   5. /usr/local/bin/node                     (Homebrew Intel, nodejs.org pkg)
#
# DORKOS_HOOK_NODE_PATHS overrides steps 2-5 with its own colon-separated list
# of candidate node BINARIES (not directories). Two uses: a machine whose node
# lives somewhere none of the above names, and the fixture suite, which sets it
# to the empty string to prove the fail-closed branch without depending on
# whether the test machine happens to have a Homebrew node. Step 1 is never
# overridden — if node is already on PATH, that is the node to use.
#
# NOTHING BELOW CALLS AN EXTERNAL COMMAND. No basename, no ls, no sort: this
# script's whole job is to behave when PATH is broken, and a PATH that is empty
# rather than merely stale would make every one of those unfindable — the same
# failure, one level down. `[`, `printf`, `case`, `set` and globbing are all
# shell builtins, so the only binary this file needs is the node it resolves.
# That is also why the version pick below is written out by hand instead of
# piping the glob through `sort -V`.
#
# THE `cd` IN FRONT OF THIS IS PART OF THE GUARD. Each guard's settings.json
# entry reads `cd "<project dir>" && <this> || exit 2`, and that trailing
# `|| exit 2` is load-bearing, not decoration. Without it two measured paths
# still failed open, both before this wrapper is ever reached:
#   - CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR naming a directory that no longer exists: the `cd`
#     fails, the shell exits 1, and 1 is non-blocking.
#   - CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR unset AND `git rev-parse` unable to answer (no git on
#     PATH, or not a checkout): the anchor expands to the empty string, `cd ""`
#     SUCCEEDS in bash leaving the directory unchanged, this file is then not
#     found at a relative path, and the shell exits 127 — also non-blocking.
# `|| exit 2` converts every non-zero outcome of the whole line, including
# both of those and a deleted wrapper, into a block. The allowed path still
# exits 0, so nothing is refused that was not already being refused.
#
# COVERAGE THIS DOES NOT HAVE (stated plainly, on purpose — this list is known
# to be incomplete, and is worth more than one that claims to be total)
#
#   - A guard entry DELETED from settings.json is not something any running
#     hook can notice; only scripts/test-run-node-hook.sh can, and it asserts
#     all three are present and wrapped.
#   - An absolute PATH directory is trusted. If someone can write a `node`
#     into /usr/local/bin they own the machine already, but say it plainly:
#     the walk below rejects the current directory, not a compromised system
#     directory.
#   - Nothing here validates that the resolved node RUNS. A node too old for
#     the guard's syntax exits non-zero, which the `|| exit 2` above turns
#     into a block rather than a silent pass — fail closed, but with a
#     confusing message.
#   - The guards' own matchers have their own holes, listed in their own
#     headers. This file only decides whether they get to run at all.
#
# Fixtures: scripts/test-run-node-hook.sh (including the two `cd` rows above,
# which it runs against the REAL command strings read out of settings.json)
