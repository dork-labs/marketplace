/**
 * Process Guard Hook
 *
 * PreToolUse(Bash) guard that refuses the process-killing commands that take
 * down processes the caller does not own, and explains what to do instead.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS CODE AND NOT PROSE
 *
 * Copied from the DorkOS app repo. On 2026-08-18 an agent there, tearing down
 * its own verification server, ran `pkill -f "tsx src/index.ts"`. That pattern
 * also matched the operator's own dev server and killed it. Nothing was lost,
 * but nothing had told the agent not to, and nothing had stopped it. The same
 * machine routinely has several agents, their test runs, and the operator's
 * own node processes alive at once (this repo's flow scripts and Vitest runs
 * are all `node`), so any kill that matches on a NAME rather than a specific
 * PID is a kill of everyone's process at once.
 *
 * WHAT IT BLOCKS
 *   - `pkill ...` in every form. It kills by name/pattern; there is no way to
 *     spell "only mine".
 *   - `killall ...` — same reason.
 *   - `kill` aimed at everything or a process group: `kill -9 -1`, `kill -1`,
 *     `kill 0`, `kill -- -1`, `kill -TERM -<pgid>`. A negative or zero target
 *     is never one process.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY ALLOWS
 *   - `kill <pid> [<pid>...]`, `kill -TERM <pid>`, `kill -9 <pid>`, `kill %1`
 *     — a specific process (or shell job) the caller can name is one it had
 *     to look at first.
 *   - `pgrep ...` — read-only. It is the way to find the PID you own.
 *   - `kill -l`, `kill -L` — lists signals.
 *
 * HOW TO STOP YOUR OWN PROCESS
 *   - Prefer the handle you already have: the PID of the process you started
 *     (`$!`, or the id the Bash tool gave you), or `TaskStop` for a
 *     background task.
 *   - Otherwise find it by the port YOU chose: `lsof -ti :<your port>` (or
 *     `pgrep -lf <pattern>` and read the list), then `kill <that pid>`. Never
 *     kill a process you did not start.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A HOOK AND NOT `permissions.deny`
 *
 * `Bash(pkill:*)` would work for the bare spelling but, as measured for
 * git-guard, the native prefix matcher does not see `sh -c "pkill ..."`,
 * `$(pkill ...)`, or `cd x && pkill ...` in the general case, and `kill` needs
 * an argument-level rule (block `-1`/`0`, allow `<pid>`) that a prefix matcher
 * cannot express.
 *
 * COVERAGE THIS DOES NOT HAVE (stated plainly, on purpose)
 *
 * It stops the reflex, not a determined bypass. It reads the command string
 * the model submits, so it does not see a kill inside a script on disk, an
 * alias, `eval "$VAR"`, `xargs kill` fed by `pgrep` (that is the
 * documented allowed path — the caller had to read the list — so it is left
 * alone on purpose), or substitutions nested more than one level deep. If you
 * find another hole, add it here even if you do not fix it.
 *
 * Contract: a PreToolUse payload on stdin, exit 2 with a message on stderr to
 * block, exit 0 to allow. Fixtures: scripts/test-process-guard.sh runs every
 * block/allow case through this entry point.

On 2026-08-18 \`pkill -f "tsx src/index.ts"\` meant to stop one verification server also killed the operator's own dev server.
Stop the process YOU started, by its PID: the id you already have (\`$!\`, the Bash tool's background id, or TaskStop for a background task), or \`lsof -ti :<your port>\` / \`pgrep -lf <pattern>\` to look first, then \`kill <pid>\`. Never kill a process you did not start.`;

const GROUP_MESSAGE = `Blocked: kill aimed at every process or a whole process group (a negative or zero target).
That signals processes you do not own — other agents' processes and the operator's servers included.
Name the one PID you started instead: \`kill <pid>\`; find it with \`lsof -ti :<your port>\` or \`pgrep -lf <pattern>\` if you have lost the handle.`;

/**
 * Decide whether a `kill` invocation targets a group or everything.
 *
 * `kill` accepts `-<signal>`, `-s <sig>`, `--signal <sig>`, `-n <num>`, and
 * `--` before its targets. A target of `0` (own process group) or any negative
 * number (`-1` = everything, `-<pgid>` = that group) is never one process. The
 * ambiguity is `-1`: as an option it is SIGHUP (`kill -1 <pid>`), as a target
 * it is "everything". Resolve it the way kill does — a leading `-<digits>` is a
 * signal when ANY further token follows it (`kill -1 12345`), and a target when
 * it stands alone, comes after `--`, or comes after another signal option. The
 * check does not require the following token to be positive on purpose: if it
 * is itself negative or zero (`kill -9 -1`) it lands in `targets` and the group
 * test below catches it anyway, so `-9` being read as a signal there is
 * harmless.
 *
 * @param {string[]} args - Tokens after the `kill` word.
 * @returns {string | null} A refusal message, or null to allow.
