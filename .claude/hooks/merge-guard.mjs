/**
 * Merge Guard Hook
 *
 * PreToolUse(Bash) guard that refuses the merge spellings which step around
 * the merge queue on an admin account, and explains what to do instead.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS CODE AND NOT PROSE
 *
 * Pull requests into `main` land through the merge queue once armed, and the
 * required checks it runs are the only thing between an agent and `main`.
 * Every agent on this machine runs as the operator's GitHub account, which
 * holds the admin role, and the branch rules let that role bypass them when it
 * merges a pull request. So one command, typed out of impatience with a slow
 * queue, lands code no required check ever ran against. A sentence in
 * CLAUDE.md does not hold that line; this guard is the reflex stop.
 *
 * Ported from dork-labs/dorkos (.claude/hooks/merge-guard.mjs) with its fixture
 * suite; only the refusal text and this header are this repo's own. Keep the
 * matcher in step with the original.
 *
 * WHAT IT BLOCKS
 *   - `gh pr merge ... --admin` (also `--admin=true`), in any argument order.
 *     gh documents `--admin` as "use administrator privileges to merge a pull
 *     request that does not meet requirements".
 *   - `gh api` with method PUT on `.../pulls/<n>/merge`: the REST merge
 *     endpoint, which merges immediately and never enters the queue. Every
 *     spelling of the method: `-X PUT`, `-XPUT`, `--method PUT`,
 *     `--method=PUT`, any case.
 *   - `gh api graphql` whose query names the `mergePullRequest` mutation, which
 *     is the same direct merge through GraphQL (and what `gh pr merge --admin`
 *     sends).
 *   - Each of those with `-R`/`--repo` anywhere gh accepts it, including
 *     between `pr` and `merge` (`gh pr -R o/r merge 12 --admin`).
 *   - Each of those behind a runner that executes its arguments (`timeout`,
 *     `exec`, `xargs`, `env -i ...`, `nice -n`, `sudo -u`, `ssh host`,
 *     `watch`; the list is RUNNERS), and in text a shell executes: a heredoc
 *     fed to `bash`/`sh -s`/`ssh`, `cat <<'EOF' | bash`, `echo '...' | sh`,
 *     `eval "$(cat <<'EOF' ...)"`.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY ALLOWS
 *   - `gh pr merge --auto <n>` (with or without a strategy flag) and a plain
 *     `gh pr merge <n>`: on a branch with a merge queue both add the pull
 *     request to the queue, so every required check still runs.
 *   - `gh pr merge --disable-auto <n>`.
 *   - `gh api .../pulls/<n>/merge` with no method (GET: "has it merged?").
 *   - Any other `gh api` PUT, and any GraphQL query or mutation that is not
 *     `mergePullRequest` (`dequeuePullRequest` included).
 *   - Text that merely names these commands: a commit message (including
 *     `git commit -F - <<'EOF'`), a PR body (including `--body-file -` from a
 *     heredoc), an `echo`, a `grep` for them, a heredoc written to a file.
 *     Only a segment whose command word is `gh` (or a runner ending in `gh`)
 *     is read, so prose inside another command's arguments never matches,
 *     unless the same line feeds a shell, where quoted text is commands.
 *
 * WHERE THE REAL PATH IS
 *
 * No agent has a sanctioned admin merge in this repo. The landing rules are in
 * CLAUDE.md ("Landing changes").
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A HOOK AND NOT `permissions.deny`
 *
 * The policy is argument-level ("`gh pr merge` yes, with `--admin` no";
 * "`gh api` yes, PUT to one endpoint no"), and a prefix matcher cannot express
 * an exception to its own prefix. Measured for git-guard: the native matcher
 * also misses `sh -c` payloads and substitutions.
 *
 * COVERAGE THIS DOES NOT HAVE (stated plainly, on purpose)
 *
 * This is the paved road, not the fence. Every agent here runs as the admin
 * account, and anything that does not show the command text to this hook
 * walks past it:
 *   - a merge inside a script on disk, an alias, a shell function, or
 *     `eval "$VAR"`, or text a shell reads from a file or a variable
 *     (`bash < merge.sh`, `echo "$CMD" | bash`);
 *   - a command run by an interpreter (`python3 -c`, `node -e`, `perl -e`)
 *     or by a runner not in RUNNERS (`find -exec`, `git rebase -x`);
 *   - `curl` (or any HTTP client) with a token from `gh auth token`;
 *   - a GraphQL query read from a file (`gh api graphql -F query=@merge.graphql`);
 *   - any harness that does not run this hook. Codex reads the generated,
 *     gitignored, trust-gated `.codex/hooks.json` that DorkOS Harness Sync
 *     writes from settings.json; whether its tool payload ever reaches this
 *     guard is unverified, so treat it as unguarded;
 *   - substitutions nested more than one level deep (the shared parser's
 *     limit, see lib/shell-command.mjs).
 * There is no server-side fence behind it in this repo. If you find another
 * hole, add it here even if you do not fix it.
 *
 * THE MATCHER SEES COMMAND TEXT AND NOTHING ELSE. Outside the text-taker
 * exemption in lib/shell-command.mjs, a line that runs one of these commands
 * inside a substitution is refused whether or not it would have run. When you
 * need to write the words, use the Write tool or a payload file on disk.
 *
 * It fails CLOSED when it cannot start: settings.json runs it through
 * .claude/hooks/run-node-hook.sh, which refuses the tool call (exit 2) when
 * node cannot be resolved (DOR-2121). It fails OPEN when it crashes on a
 * payload, like its siblings, so a parser bug cannot block every Bash call.
 *
 * Fixtures: scripts/test-merge-guard.sh runs every block/allow case through
 * this file's real entry point (a PreToolUse payload on stdin, exit 2 to
 * block); scripts/test-run-node-hook.sh covers the fail-closed wrapper.
