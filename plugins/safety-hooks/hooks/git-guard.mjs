/**
 * Git Guard Hook
 *
 * PreToolUse(Bash) guard that refuses the git commands that have destroyed
 * work in a shared checkout, and explains what to do instead.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS CODE AND NOT PROSE
 *
 * Written for the DorkOS app repo, where the incidents below happened. The
 * shared-stash hazard applies to any repo with worktrees.
 *
 * On 2026-07-22, in one session:
 *   - An agent ran `git stash -u` in a worktree while a background job was
 *     mid-test-run, reverting its own tree. Its follow-up `git stash pop`
 *     against an already-clean tree popped the USER's 2026-07-22 checkpoint
 *     and started deleting tracked files. Recovered with `git reset --hard`.
 *   - Three separate agents ran `git checkout -- <file>` on uncommitted work
 *     and each silently reverted legitimate edits.
 * Every one of those agents had "do not use these" in its brief. Prose did not
 * hold, so this is a guard.
 *
 * `refs/stash` lives in the COMMON git dir, so one stash stack is shared by
 * the main checkout and every worktree. A `pop` in any worktree can therefore
 * land another writer's stash on top of your tree. (Some setups also keep
 * auto-checkpoints there from a Stop hook.)
 *
 * WHAT IT BLOCKS
 *   - `git stash` and every subcommand except the two read-only ones
 *     (`list`, `show`).
 *   - `git checkout -- <path>`, `git checkout HEAD -- <path>`, and the bare
 *     pathspec forms `git checkout .` / `./x` / `../x`.
 *   - `git restore <path>` and `git restore --staged --worktree <path>` when
 *     no source other than HEAD is named.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY ALLOWS
 *   - `git stash list`, `git stash show` — read-only, and the way you prove
 *     nothing was lost.
 *   - `git checkout <branch>`, `-b`, `<sha>`, `git worktree *`, `git clean`,
 *     `git reset --hard <sha>` (the documented recovery path).
 *   - Forms that name a source other than HEAD — `git checkout <sha> -- f`,
 *     `git restore --source=HEAD~1 f`. Those overwrite uncommitted edits too,
 *     but they are a deliberate retrieval of a specific version and git has no
 *     other spelling for it. HEAD is excluded because `--source=HEAD` is a
 *     pure discard of your own work wearing the retrieval spelling.
 *   - `git restore --staged <path>` — unstages only, the working tree is
 *     untouched.
 *   - `--ours` / `--theirs` — merge-conflict resolution, not a blind discard.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A HOOK AND NOT `permissions.deny`
 *
 * A declarative `Bash(git stash:*)` deny rule was the preferred answer, and it
 * was measured against live headless sessions before being rejected. What the
 * runs showed (Claude Code 2.1.219):
 *   - `cd /tmp && git stash` IS denied. The native matcher splits compound
 *     commands, so that half of the worry was unfounded.
 *   - `git -C somedir stash` is NOT denied. It ran.
 *   - `git stash list` IS denied. That is fatal: the read-only commands are how
 *     you prove nothing was lost, and deny is evaluated before allow with no
 *     exceptions, so no allow rule can carve them back out.
 * The policy is "block git stash EXCEPT list and show", and a prefix matcher
 * with unconditional deny precedence cannot express an exception. Same for
 * checkout: `Bash(git checkout:*)` would block `git checkout main`.
 *
 * COVERAGE THIS DOES NOT HAVE (stated plainly, on purpose)
 *
 * Treat this list as the contract. It is known to be incomplete in the two
 * ways named at the end, and it is worth more than a list that claims to be
 * total: an earlier version of this block omitted the loop and subshell forms
 * below and read as exhaustive, which is the exact defect DorkOS has been
 * removing. If you find another hole, add it here even if you do not fix it.
 *
 * It stops the reflex, not a determined bypass. It reads the command string
 * the model submits, so it does not see:
 *   - a destructive git command inside a script on disk (`./do-it.sh`), a
 *     shell function, an alias, or `eval "$VAR"`;
 *   - a bare `xargs git ...` or `find -exec git ...`, or `git` reached under
 *     another name (a substitution inside their quoted arguments IS caught,
 *     because neither is a text-taker, so the line is scanned strictly);
 *   - `$(...)` nested more than one level deep, or inside `$( )` containing
 *     its own parentheses, or `sh -c` nested past two levels;
 *   - `git checkout <ambiguous-path>` when it is the ONLY positional and has
 *     no leading `./`, which is indistinguishable from `git checkout <branch>`
 *     without asking git what refs exist. Blocking it would also block
 *     `git checkout main`, and a guard that blocks `git checkout main` gets
 *     switched off. (Two or more positionals IS decidable, and is blocked.)
 *   - a source that resolves to your current commit without being spelled
 *     `HEAD` — the current branch name (`git checkout main -- f` while on
 *     main), or an explicit sha of HEAD. Measured: destroys the edit, allowed
 *     by this guard. Closing it needs git to resolve the ref, which a
 *     PreToolUse string matcher cannot do. This is the price of the retrieval
 *     exemption, and it is a smaller hole than removing that exemption.
 *
 * It DOES handle, all measured against real git: one level of `sh -c` /
 * `bash -c` and `$(...)`; subshells `( ... )`, brace groups `{ ...; }`, and
 * `for` / `while` / `if` bodies; compound splitting on `&& || ; | |& &` and
 * newlines; whitespace collapsing; and quoting, so
 * `git commit -m "ran git stash"` is not a false positive. It also unwraps the
 * literal argument of `eval '...'` the way it unwraps `sh -c`.
 *
 * A substitution inside single quotes or a quoted heredoc (`<<'EOF'`) is
 * treated as text ONLY when every command on the line is a known text-taker
 * (`echo`, `printf`, `cat`, `tee`, `git commit`, `git tag`, and the `gh pr` /
 * `gh issue` / `gh release` commands that post text; the list is `TEXT_TAKERS`
 * in lib/shell-command.mjs). So `git commit -m 'never use `git stash`'` and a
 * `gh pr create --body "$(cat <<'EOF' ... EOF)"` naming it are allowed, while
 * `trap`, `xargs`, `find -exec`, `git rebase -x`, `sh -c`, `eval` and anything
 * unlisted get every substitution-shaped span inspected, quoted or not. Even
 * a text-taker line goes strict when it holds a `#` comment, `$'...'`, a quote
 * inside backticks, a single quote inside `$(...)`, `case` inside `$(...)`, a
 * heredoc with a delimiter other than letters, digits and `_`, a heredoc
 * inside `$(...)` that is not the whole `cat <<'WORD'` substitution with a
 * plain body, an unterminated quote, or a heredoc that never closes. Those
 * lines can still be refused for merely naming a blocked command; that is the
 * chosen cost.
 *
 * It also never sees commands run by OTHER hooks: PreToolUse fires on tool
 * calls in the agentic loop only, so a hook script may still call
 * `git stash create` / `git stash store` even though this guard refuses both
 * when a model types them.
 *
 * Fixtures: scripts/test-git-guard.sh runs every block/allow case through
 * this file's real entry point. Run it after any change to this file or to
 * lib/shell-command.mjs.

The stash is shared. Every worktree and the main checkout read and write one
stash list. A stash here can revert a tree someone else is using, and a pop
here can drop another writer's stash on top of your files and delete them.
Both of those happened on 2026-07-22 in the DorkOS repo this guard was written for.

Do this instead: copy the files you want to park into your session scratchpad,
then put them back with cp when you are done.

Still allowed: git stash list and git stash show. They only read, and they are
how you check that nothing was lost.`;

This throws away your own uncommitted edits, and there is no undo. Three
agents ran it on 2026-07-22 and each one silently reverted work it had just
written.

Check first: run git diff <path> and read what you are about to lose. To park
changes, copy the file to your session scratchpad and bring it back with cp.

Still allowed: git checkout <branch> and git checkout -b <new-branch>, which
do not touch your edits.

Also allowed, but read this before reaching for it: git checkout <commit> --
<path> when you name a commit other than HEAD. That is for pulling back one
specific old version on purpose. It overwrites your uncommitted edits just as
badly, so it is not a way around this message.`;

This is git checkout -- <path> under a newer name: it throws away your own
uncommitted edits with no undo. Three agents lost work to that on 2026-07-22.

Check first: run git diff <path> and read what you are about to lose. To park
changes, copy the file to your session scratchpad and bring it back with cp.

your file alone.
