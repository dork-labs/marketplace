/**
 * Fail-open safety suite for the `/flow auto` Stop hook (`.claude/hooks/flow-loop.mjs`).
 *
 * The hook runs on EVERY session's Stop. The single most important invariant is
 * that a session with NO active `/flow auto` run ALWAYS allows the stop — getting
 * this wrong would trap every session in an infinite loop. The hook's decision is
 * the pure exported {@link decideStop}; this suite pins its fail-open behavior.
 *
 * The hook is plain `.mjs` (no types) and lives outside `packages/flow`; it is
 * imported by relative path. `src/__tests__/**` is excluded from this package's
 * tsc, so the untyped import is fine — vitest resolves it at runtime.
