/**
 * Agent-as-team-member integration suite (§5, §7; Phase 3 acceptance) — the
 * "comment-rule suite wired to the **real** ownership primitive". The unit
 * suites test {@link classifyOwnership} and {@link shouldRespondToComment} in
 * isolation (each injecting the other's input); this suite proves the two TS
 * pieces actually **compose** the way the agent-as-team-member loop composes
 * them: feed a `WorkItem` through the REAL {@link classifyOwnership}
 * (`identity.ts`, task 3.1) and inject its `OwnershipClass` output straight into
 * {@link shouldRespondToComment} (`comment-response.ts`), then walk the five
 * comment-response rules across the matrix.
 *
 * Imports from the relative module paths (`../identity.js`,
 * `../comment-response.js`) — NOT the `@dorkos/flow` barrel — matching the other
 * flow suites; the orchestrator wires barrel exports later.
 *
 * @see specs/unified-workflow-system/02-specification.md §5 (comment-response), §7 (ownership)
 * @see .agents/flow/skills/tending-tracker/SKILL.md (the prose loop these pieces back)
