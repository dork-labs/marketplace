description: The /flow engine's DECOMPOSE stage — break a validated specification into actionable tasks in 03-tasks.json, mirror the active phase into the tracker as a plan checklist, and project the stage/decompose label. Use when running /flow:decompose or advancing a work item into the DECOMPOSE stage.

# Decomposing Work — the DECOMPOSE stage

> **Stage:** DECOMPOSE (spec §1). One generic, PM-agnostic stage skill.
> **Absorbs:** today's `/spec:decompose` and `/spec:tasks-sync`.
> **PM projection (tracker):** `stage/decompose` label + the active-phase plan
> checklist mirrored into the work item.
> **Trigger doors:** the thin `/flow:decompose` command _or_ a PM transition into
> the DECOMPOSE stage are two triggers for this one skill.

This skill turns a frozen specification into the single source of truth for
implementation — `specs/<slug>/03-tasks.json` — and keeps the tracker in sync as
a _projection_ of it. The filesystem is canonical; the tracker holds pointers +
state + the plan checklist, never a second copy of the prose (spec §8).

## The one tracker rule

This is a generic stage skill. **It never touches a tracker API string.** Every
read or write to the tracker — the plan-checklist mirror, the `stage/decompose`
transition, any breadcrumb comment, sub-issue promotion — goes through the
**adapter** skill by naming its capability verbs (`transition`,
`comment`, `createSubIssue`, `getRelations`). No raw tracker tool name, CLI
invocation, or slug lives here. (The `tracker-confinement` Vitest guard enforces
this for the whole flow bundle.)

## Process

### 1. Resolve the spec and slug

```
SPEC_FILE = the spec path from the trigger arguments
SLUG      = second path segment (e.g. "user-auth" from
            "specs/user-auth/02-specification.md")
TASKS_JSON = "specs/<SLUG>/03-tasks.json"
TASKS_MD   = "specs/<SLUG>/03-tasks.md"
```

Verify `SPEC_FILE` exists and is a valid specification (has the expected
sections). If it does not, stop and report — DECOMPOSE only runs on a frozen
spec (SPECIFY's output).

### 2. Detect mode (full · incremental · skip)

- **No `03-tasks.json`, or no matching tasks** in the built-in Task API for this
  slug → **full mode**.
- **`03-tasks.json` exists** → compare its `generatedAt` against the spec's
  changelog. New changelog entries → **incremental mode** (preserve DONE tasks,
  update affected pending tasks, create only new work). No new entries →
  **skip mode**: report "No changes since last decompose (<date>); delete
  `03-tasks.json` to force" and exit early.

### 3. Produce `03-tasks.json` + `03-tasks.md` (background agent)

Spawn a background `general-purpose` agent to do the heavy analysis off the main
context (saves ~90% of main context), writing **both** files to disk:

- `specs/<SLUG>/03-tasks.json` — machine-readable, the canonical schema below.
- `specs/<SLUG>/03-tasks.md` — human-readable breakdown for browsing + diffs.

The agent has **no** Task-API access; the main context creates tasks in step 4.

**Canonical `03-tasks.json` schema** (the existing schema, extended per spec §8):

```jsonc
{
  "spec": "<SPEC_PATH>",
  "slug": "<SLUG>",
  "generatedAt": "<ISO 8601>",
  "mode": "full | incremental",
  "lastDecomposeDate": "<DATE | null>",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "1.1", // Phase.TaskNumber
      "phase": 1,
      "phaseName": "Foundation",
      "subject": "[<SLUG>] [P1] Imperative task title",
      "description": "FULL self-contained implementation detail",
      "activeForm": "Present-continuous spinner form",
      "size": "small | medium | large | xl",
      "priority": "high | medium | low",
      "dependencies": ["1.0"],
      "parallelWith": ["1.2", "1.3"],

      // Spec §8 schema extension — the ONLY place the task→issue map lives.
      // Populated only when a task is promoted to its own tracker sub-issue
      // (step 6). Absent otherwise; most tasks stay checklist-only.
      "issue": null,
      "parentIssue": null,
    },
  ],
}
```

**Content rule (critical):** descriptions are copied verbatim and self-contained
— full code blocks, technical requirements, and acceptance criteria with test
scenarios. The main context copies them into the Task API unchanged; there is no
second pass. Forbidden summarization phrases: "as specified", "from the spec",
"see specification", "as described above", "implement according to spec". If the
agent catches itself writing one, it stops and copies the real content.

### 4. Create tasks in the built-in Task API (main context)

This absorbs `/spec:tasks-sync`'s sync logic — it runs unconditionally as the tail
of decompose, and is also the manual repair path when JSON exists but the Task
API is empty.

1. Read `specs/<SLUG>/03-tasks.json`. If missing/malformed, fall back to parsing
   `03-tasks.md` (header pattern `^### Task (\d+)\.(\d+): (.+)$`, deriving
   `activeForm` from the imperative title), or re-run step 3.
2. List existing tasks for the slug (`TaskList()` filtered to `[<slug>]`); skip
   any already present (idempotent — safe to re-run).
3. For each missing task: `TaskCreate({ subject, description, activeForm })`,
   retrying once on failure. Track `task.id → created taskId`.
4. Resolve dependencies: for each task with `dependencies`,
   `TaskUpdate({ taskId, addBlockedBy: deps.map(id → createdId) })`. Skip deps
   whose task is absent.
5. Spot-check 2–3 created descriptions for the forbidden phrases; warn (don't
   block) if found.

The built-in Task API is a **live-display projection** of `03-tasks.json`, not a
parallel source of truth (spec §8 — collapse the dual task system).

### 5. Mirror the plan into the tracker (via the adapter)

Project the decomposition onto the work item — never authored independently:

- Via the adapter, `transition` the work item into the DECOMPOSE stage (sets the
  `stage/decompose` label).
- Mirror the **active phase** as a plan checklist on the work item, **generated
  from `03-tasks.json`, never hand-edited.** This is a projection: regenerate it
  from the canonical file rather than editing it in place.
- Optionally drop a breadcrumb `comment` (decomposed into N tasks; next stage is
  EXECUTE).
- **Ready the execute-ready work for dispatch.** Once the plan is mirrored and the
  spec is decomposed into actionable tasks, via the adapter apply the
  durable `agent/ready` label to the execute-ready work item (and to any task
  promoted to its own sub-issue in step 6). The work item carrying the decomposed
  plan becomes dispatchable **only once `agent/ready` is applied**: the dispatch
  eligibility gate (the `agent/ready` constant `node .agents/flow/scripts/dispatch.mjs`
  matches on, unconditionally) holds out anything lacking it. This is the **second readiness
  producer** after TRIAGE (the first, on accept; see `triaging-work`): DECOMPOSE
  readies the work it hands to EXECUTE so the dispatch loop has fuel.

If no work item is linked (provenance block absent) or the tracker is
unavailable, skip the tracker mirror silently — decomposition on disk still
succeeds. Tracker integration is always optional.

### 6. Sub-issue promotion (the rare exception)

Promote a task to its own tracker sub-issue **only** when
`size ≥ decomposition.subIssueThreshold` (default `"xl"`); the parent's size does
not additionally gate (spec §8). The vast majority of tasks stay checklist lines.
When promotion fires: via the adapter, `createSubIssue(parent, spec)`, then write
the returned identifier into that task's `issue` field (and `parentIssue`) in
`03-tasks.json` — the canonical, normalized home of the task→issue mapping. A flat
top-level `issues: […]` list is rejected (it duplicates the map and reintroduces
drift).

### 7. Report

Report the spec path, mode, the two files written, the task counts by phase, the
parallel/critical-path summary, any promoted sub-issues (each as identifier with
title, `PROJ-157 - Title`, per the adapter's display convention), and the next
stage: EXECUTE (`/flow:execute specs/<SLUG>/02-specification.md`).

## Calibration (spec §5)

DECOMPOSE is an **execution stage**: in the ambiguous middle (reversible +
not-confident), it **proceeds on the best default and logs the assumption**
(`agent/assumption` comment via the adapter + a note in the task) rather than
stopping to ask. The floor (row 0 — irreversible/outward-facing/secrets) still
stops and asks via the adapter's `needsInput`. The plan-approval gate after
DECOMPOSE is **off by default** (`gates.planApproval: false`); the engine flows
straight to EXECUTE and surfaces plan assumptions at the human-review gate.

## Guardrails

- Filesystem (`03-tasks.json`) is canonical; the tracker mirror is a projection.
- Never hand-edit the plan checklist; regenerate it from `03-tasks.json`.
- Keep descriptions self-contained — no summarization placeholders.
- All tracker I/O through the adapter. No tracker strings in this skill.
