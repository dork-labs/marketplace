<!--
  /flow draft-ADR doc scaffold — `decisions/NNNN-<kebab-slug>.md`.
  Externalized from the legacy `/ideate-to-spec` auto-extract step so the
  SPECIFY stage skill (`specifying-work`) carries no inline ADR template.
  This is the canonical draft-ADR scaffold of the `/flow` doc-template set
  (`templates/docs/`). One ADR per architectural decision surfaced during
  SPECIFY.

  `NNNN` comes from `decisions/manifest.json` `nextNumber`; increment it per
  ADR and add a manifest entry with `"status": "draft"` and
  `"extractedFrom": "<slug>"`.
