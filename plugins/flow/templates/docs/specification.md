  /flow SPECIFY-stage doc scaffold — `specs/<slug>/02-specification.md`.
  Externalized from the legacy `/spec:create` command so the SPECIFY stage
  skill (`specifying-work`) stays thin and carries no inline template. This is
  the canonical SPECIFY scaffold of the `/flow` doc-template set
  (`templates/docs/`).

  Fill every section meaningfully — a reader should be able to build the work
  from this document alone. Do NOT include time or effort estimates. Carry all
  ideation research forward; never paraphrase away precision.
