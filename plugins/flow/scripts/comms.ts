/**
 * Comms routing (§5) — the typed answer to "when the calibration ladder
 * (task 2.1) decides to **stop-and-ask**, _how_ does the agent reach the human?".
 *
 * The calibration ladder decides *whether* to involve a human; this module
 * decides the **channel**. The two are orthogonal: the ladder yields a
 * `stop-and-ask` behavior, and {@link resolveCommsChannel} maps the *trigger that
 * started the run* plus the detected {@link IdentityMode} onto one of three
 * channels:
 *
 * - **`interactive`** — a CLI run with a live terminal/session (either identity
 *   mode). The agent asks inline via `AskUserQuestion`; the human answers in the
 *   same breath, the loop never parks. This is the `/flow` / `/flow:<stage>` /
 *   `/flow auto` foreground experience.
 * - **`comment-and-assign`** — an unattended run in **two-account** mode (a Pulse
 *   tick / away run with a distinct reviewer account). The agent runs the
 *   adapter's `needsInput` primitive: post a comment carrying the
 *   `identity.marker`, apply `agent/needs-input`, assign the issue to the reviewer
 *   (whose distinct account gets a real notification), and **stop**. It resumes
 *   only when the human replies, surfaced by `getInbox` (and read back by the
 *   comment-response rules, {@link shouldRespondToComment}).
 * - **`comment-and-nudge`** — an unattended run in **shared-account** mode (agent
 *   acts *as* the human's account). Same durable record (comment +
 *   `agent/needs-input`), but the assignment notifies no one (assigning to
 *   yourself), so the out-of-band nudge (Relay / Telegram / chat) is **promoted to
 *   the primary attention channel** — see {@link CommsRoute.nudgePrimary}. It
 *   resumes the same way, on a non-agent reply disambiguated by the marker.
 *
 * ## Trigger source ⟂ execution mode (the §2 orthogonality)
 *
 * The *trigger* (manual CLI vs PM-driven) is orthogonal to the *execution mode*
 * (step vs autonomous). `/flow auto` is **manual + autonomous**: it drains the
 * queue autonomously yet is a live terminal session, so its comms channel is
 * `interactive` — the human is right there. A Pulse tick is **PM-driven +
 * autonomous** with no live session, so it routes to `comment-and-assign`. The
 * channel keys off `liveSession`, never off the autonomy of the run.
 *
 * ## Config-overridable
 *
 * `involvement.comms` defaults to `"infer-from-trigger"` (the behavior above).
 * An operator who sets it to `"concise"` / `"verbose"` is choosing a *tone*, not
 * a *channel* — the channel still infers from the trigger + identity mode. The
 * routing inputs are the live-session signal on the trigger and the detected
 * {@link IdentityMode}; tone never re-routes. The out-of-band
 * {@link CommsRoute.nudge} flags (`involvement.nudge`) ride alongside `interactive`
 * / `comment-and-assign` as a courtesy ping (Relay / Telegram), but on
 * `comment-and-nudge` (shared mode) the nudge is **promoted to the primary** ask
 * ({@link CommsRoute.nudgePrimary}), because the tracker assignment reaches no one.
 *
 * **This module is the pinned oracle**, mirroring the prose comms rules the v1
 * stage skills follow, and is the P5 promotion surface (the server build calls it
 * directly). Every behavior is driven from {@link InvolvementSchema} config so
 * re-tuning comms is a config edit, never a code change.
 *
 * @see specs/unified-workflow-system/02-specification.md §5 (comms channel)
 * @see .agents/flow/skills/linear-adapter/SKILL.md (`needsInput`, `getInbox`)
 * @module @dorkos/flow/comms

 * Resolve the comms channel for a `stop-and-ask` decision (§5) from the trigger

 *
 * Two signals pick the channel, in order:
 *
 * 1. **Is a human reachable inline right now?** A live CLI session (manual +
 *    `liveSession`) always asks **interactively** (`AskUserQuestion`), in *either*
 *    identity mode — the human is right there, so the tracker is moot. This keeps
 *    `/flow auto` (manual + autonomous, live terminal) interactive.
 * 2. **Otherwise the run is unattended — does a distinct reviewer account exist?**
 *    The {@link IdentityMode} decides:
 *    - **`two-account`** → **`comment-and-assign`**: comment + `agent/needs-input`
 *      + assign to the distinct reviewer (the assignment fires a real
 *      notification) + stop; resume on their reply.
 *    - **`shared`** → **`comment-and-nudge`**: comment + `agent/needs-input` (the
 *      durable record) + an out-of-band nudge **promoted to primary**. In shared
 *      mode `assignToHuman` is a no-op (agent and human are one account, so the
 *      tracker notifies no one), so the nudge is the channel that actually reaches
 *      the human, not a courtesy ping.
 *
 * The autonomy of the run (step vs autonomous, §2) never enters the decision —
 * only live-reachability and identity mode do. `involvement.comms` is
 * `"infer-from-trigger"` by default; `"concise"`/`"verbose"` select a *tone*, not
 * a *channel*, so they never re-route. The returned {@link CommsRoute.nudge}
 * carries the `involvement.nudge` flags verbatim, and {@link CommsRoute.nudgePrimary}
 * marks whether the nudge is the primary channel (only on `comment-and-nudge`).
 *
 * @param trigger - The trigger that started the run (source + live-session flag).
 * @param identityMode - The detected identity mode (`resolveIdentityMode`), which
 *   splits the unattended case between assign (two-account) and nudge (shared).
 * @param involvement - The resolved `involvement` config block.
 * @returns The channel to reach the human through, the nudge flags, and whether
 *   the nudge is the primary attention channel.
