/**
 * Identity & ownership model (§7) — the `/flow` engine's **one primitive, two
 * consumers**. {@link classifyOwnership} is the single function that decides who
 * owns a work item; its {@link OwnershipClass} result drives **both** dispatch
 * eligibility (§4, the {@link isClaimable} gate in `dispatch.ts`) and
 * comment-handling (§5, the rules in `comment-response.ts`). Those two modules
 * consume the class as an **injected input** — this module is what they inject.
 *
 * ## Governing principle (§7)
 *
 * Ownership/authorship live in **labels + a comment marker** (durable, always
 * present); a dedicated agent tracker account is a cleaner *enhancement* when it
 * exists. The engine therefore runs in one of two identity modes, **detected**
 * (never configured) from {@link Identity.reviewer}:
 *
 * - **Two-account (ideal)** — the agent ({@link Identity.agent}) and the human
 *   reviewer ({@link Identity.reviewer}) have **distinct** tracker accounts, so
 *   assignee + authorship are unambiguous and {@link classifyOwnership} can
 *   distinguish `mine` from `reviewer` purely from the assignee.
 * - **Shared-account (fallback)** — the agent acts *as* the human's account.
 *   `agent === reviewer`, so the assignee alone can no longer separate the two:
 *   a self-assignment is still {@link OwnershipClass | `mine`} (the agent's
 *   account is the assignee), but the **claim** must additionally carry the
 *   `agent/claimed` label — see {@link SHARED_MODE_CLAIM_LABEL}. The agent
 *   recognizes its own comments by {@link Identity.marker} and hands off by
 *   label + nudge. Mode detection: see {@link resolveIdentityMode}.
 *
 * ## Identity resolution (the `"auto"` contract)
 *
 * **No personal identity ships in the package** — the §9 defaults
 * (`identity.agent: "auto"`, `identity.reviewer: null`) resolve at runtime from
 * the installer's authenticated account via the adapter's `getCurrentUser`.
 * This module takes the **already-resolved** {@link Identity} as input: the
 * runtime resolves `"auto"` → the authenticated account id (and may resolve
 * `reviewer` from `null`) *before* calling {@link classifyOwnership}. This
 * module never reads config defaults or calls the adapter; it is pure.
 *
 * ## Scope — issues AND projects (§7, `ownership.scope`)
 *
 * The same primitive classifies an **issue** (via its `assignee`) and a
 * **project** (via its `project.lead`), honoring `ownership.scope:
 * ["issues","projects"]`. {@link classifyOwnership} selects the owner field by
 * the requested {@link OwnershipScope}.
 *
 * @see specs/unified-workflow-system/02-specification.md §7 (identity & ownership)
 * @see ./dispatch.ts ({@link isClaimable} — the dispatch consumer)
 * @see ./comment-response.ts (`shouldRespondToComment` — the comment consumer)
 * @module @dorkos/flow/identity
