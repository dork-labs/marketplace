/**
 * Evidence selection (§13) — the typed answer to "for a given change surface and
 * the trigger that started the VERIFY run, _what_ proof-of-completion does the
 * agent capture, and _where_ does it attach?".
 *
 * VERIFY (the `verifying-work` skill) is the proof stage: it answers "does this
 * actually do what the spec asked?" with evidence, never assertion. The *capture
 * format* and *attach target* are both config-driven from {@link EvidenceSchema}
 * (`.agents/flow/config.json` → `evidence`), so re-tuning proof policy is a config
 * edit, never a code change. This module is the pinned oracle for that policy: it
 * mirrors the prose evidence rules the v1 `verifying-work` skill follows, and is
 * the P5 promotion surface (the server-side unattended pipeline, DOR-95, calls it
 * directly).
 *
 * ## The three evidence classes (§13)
 *
 * - **`ui`** — a visible surface changed. Proof is a recording. With
 *   `evidence.ui: "auto"` the *format* resolves on the trigger: an **interactive**
 *   run (a live CLI/session, where `gif_creator` from claude-in-chrome is
 *   available) captures an **annotated GIF**; an **unattended** run (a Pulse tick /
 *   CI, no live session) captures a **WebM** via Playwright's `recordVideo` — the
 *   path already wired into `apps/e2e` (`video: 'retain-on-failure'`). The
 *   non-`auto` modes pin a single format: `"screenshot"` → a still; `"off"` → no
 *   UI capture.
 * - **`temporal`** — motion/behavior over time is the thing under test. Proof is a
 *   moving recording regardless of trigger (`evidence.temporal`, default
 *   `"video"`; `"gif"` forces the annotated GIF; `"off"` skips it).
 * - **`logic`** — server/logic with no visible surface. Proof is the verification
 *   command summary (`evidence.logic`, default `"test-summary"`; `"full-output"`
 *   attaches the raw command output; `"off"` skips it).
 *
 * ## Interactive ⟂ format (mirrors the comms split)
 *
 * The capture *format* keys off whether a live interactive session is attached
 * right now — the same `liveSession` signal {@link resolveCommsChannel} routes
 * comms on — never off the autonomy of the run. `/flow auto` is autonomous yet
 * **interactive** (live terminal, `gif_creator` reachable → annotated GIF); a
 * Pulse tick is autonomous and **unattended** (no terminal → WebM `recordVideo`).
 *
 * ## Scope boundary (v1 vs P5 / DOR-95)
 *
 * This module is a **pure selector**: it decides *what to capture and where to
 * attach*. It does not record, upload, or call a tracker — capture is performed by
 * the skill (`gif_creator` interactively, `apps/e2e` `recordVideo` for WebM) and
 * attachment routes through the `linear-adapter` (`attachEvidence`). The
 * unattended/server variant (headless `recordVideo` → automated Linear
 * `fileUpload`/`attachmentCreate`) is the **P5 Extension's job (DOR-95)**; v1
 * attaches what an interactive/CLI run produces plus the `apps/e2e` WebM. The
 * selector's output is identical across v1 and P5 — only the executor changes.
 *
 * @see specs/unified-workflow-system/02-specification.md §13 (browser proof-of-completion)
 * @see .agents/flow/skills/verifying-work/SKILL.md (the VERIFY stage skill)
