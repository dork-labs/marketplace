/**
 * The **baseline reconcilers** (task 2.5) — the concrete {@link Reconciler}s that
 * wrap the existing typed oracles with **no new decision logic**. Each is the
 * cadence + plumbing around a pure oracle that already owns the decision:
 *
 * | reconciler | wraps                       | decision oracle           |
 * | ---------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------- |
 * | `recovery` | re-adopt orphaned claims    | `recoverOrphan`           |
 * | `inbox`    | resume parked answers       | `shouldRespondToComment`  |
 * | `review`   | clear approved PRs          | `evaluateAutoMerge`       |
 * | `dispatch` | claim the top-ranked item   | `selectDispatch`          |
 * | `triage`   | ready shapeable backlog     | (delegates to the skill)  |
 * | `hygiene`  | surface starvation          | `classifyDispatchOutcome` |
 *
 * The `recovery` reconciler (priority 10, task 3.3) wraps the `recoverOrphan`
 * ladder and sorts at the HEAD of the tick so an orphan is re-adopted before
 * `dispatch` tries to claim it (same-item contention by priority). The `inbox`
 * reconciler (priority 20, task 4.6) wraps `shouldRespondToComment` over the
 * `comment.added` events the tick polls from the injected `InboundTransport`
 * (`transport.ts`), un-parking an answered `agent/needs-input` item before any
 * fresh claim. The set orders `recovery (10) < inbox (20) < review (25) <
 * dispatch (30) < triage (40) < hygiene (50)`.
 *
 * ## The act is the decision, not I/O
 *
 * In v1 the side-effecting work (claim, merge, comment) is performed by the prose
 * loop / the P5 runner that consumes the {@link ReconcileResult}; these typed
 * reconcilers re-derive truth and return WHAT to do. That keeps them pure and
 * testable — exactly like the oracles they wrap — and is what makes them the P5
 * promotion surface. Each reconciler's `defaultConfig` is read straight from the
 * resolved `loops` schema default ({@link LoopsSchema}), so the registry order and
 * the config block can never drift.
 *
 * @see ./reconciler.ts (the typed contract — task 2.1)
 * @see ./scheduler.ts (the registry + scheduler — task 2.2)
 * @see specs/flow-triage-feeds-loop/02-specification.md §3
