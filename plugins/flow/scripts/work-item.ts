/**
 * The generic, tracker-agnostic `WorkItem` shape — the `/flow` engine's single
 * work model. Every tracker adapter (Linear in v1; Jira / GitHub Issues in the
 * P5 server build) normalizes its native issues into this shape, so the generic
 * layer — the dispatch policy (§4), comment handling (§5), ownership
 * classification (§7), and the inbox — never sees a tracker-specific field name.
 *
 * This is the **TypeScript mirror** of the prose `WorkItem` contract documented
 * in `.agents/flow/skills/linear-adapter/SKILL.md` ("The `WorkItem`
 * normalization shape"). The skill is the runtime contract the agent follows in
 * v1 (server-free, skill-based); this module is the typed shape the dispatch
 * library and downstream tasks (2.4 comms, 3.1 `classifyOwnership`, 3.2 inbox)
 * import and program against. Keep the two in lockstep.
 *
 * ## `stateCategory` is matched on CATEGORY, never on display name
 *
 * Tracker workflow states each belong to one of five **categories**
 * (`backlog · unstarted · started · completed · canceled`). The display
 * {@link WorkItem.stateName | `stateName`} ("Triage", "In Progress", "Shipped",
 * …) is team-customizable and varies per team — matching on it is brittle. The
 * generic layer branches **only** on {@link WorkItem.stateCategory}.
 *
 * ## Graceful degradation
 *
 * The adapter populates every field it can and leaves the rest `undefined`; it
 * never fabricates a value to satisfy the shape. The dispatch policy treats
 * missing {@link WorkItem.priority} / {@link WorkItem.size} as **neutral**
 * (never as a real value) — "neutral" must never be confused with "smallest" or
 * "lowest priority". A missing optional is **absent**, never `null`: the
 * conformance harness rejects `null`, and the dispatch oracle degrades it to
 * neutral rather than trusting the shape.
 *
 * @see specs/unified-workflow-system/02-specification.md §3 (PMClient contract), §4 (dispatch)
 * @see .agents/flow/skills/linear-adapter/SKILL.md (the prose WorkItem contract)
