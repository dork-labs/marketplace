/**
 * The typed **`FlowRun` writer/reader** for `.dork/flow/flow-state.json` (§12,
 * tasks 3.1/3.5) — the durable run store keyed by issue id (`Record<issueId,
 * FlowRun>`). This module is the **schema-of-record** the v1 prose drain mirrors
 * and the P5 server (DOR-89) imports verbatim.
 *
 * ## Pure by construction — the fs lives at the seam, never in the package
 *
 * `@dorkos/flow` performs **no** filesystem I/O (see `contributing/flow-engine.md`:
 * "none performs I/O"). This module preserves that: the actual read/write of
 * `flow-state.json` is the **consumer's** job, reached through an injected
 * {@link FlowStateStore} seam — exactly mirroring how `dispatch.ts` injects
 * `classifyOwnership` instead of resolving ownership itself. The pure core is:
 *
 * - {@link parseFlowState} — `fromJSON`: validate raw text → records, fail-soft to
 *   `{}` (never throws), like the Stop-hook sentinel reader.
 * - {@link serializeFlowState} — `toJSON`: records → canonical JSON text.
 * - {@link pruneClosedRuns} — the pure GC/reconcile: given the records + a
 *   ground-truth `isClosed` signal, return which to keep and how many were dropped.
 *
 * The {@link FlowStateStore}-shaped helpers ({@link readFlowState},
 * {@link writeFlowRun}, {@link updateFlowRunStatus}, {@link gcFlowState}) are thin
 * read-mutate-write wrappers over that pure core; the store supplies the bytes.
 * The v1 prose drain (task 3.5) backs the store with `readFileSync`/`writeFileSync`
 * on `.dork/flow/flow-state.json` (resolved relative to the repo root, NOT via
 * `os.homedir()` — the packages rule); the P5 server backs it with the same file
 * then its SQLite mirror (ADR-0043 file-first write-through).
 *
 * @see ./flow-run.ts ({@link FlowRun} — the record schema + the recovery oracle)
 * @see specs/flow-triage-feeds-loop/02-specification.md §6 (the FlowRun record + recovery wiring)
 * @module @dorkos/flow/flow-state
