/**
 * Comment-response rules (§5) — reading the comms channel *back*. The typed
 * answer to "a comment landed on a tracker item the agent can see; should the
 * agent act on it, and why?".
 *
 * This is the inbound half of comms ({@link resolveCommsChannel} is the
 * outbound half). When the agent asks via `comment-and-assign` it parks on
 * `agent/needs-input`; the human's reply arrives through `getInbox` and must be
 * recognized as the answer (rule 3). But the same inbox also surfaces unrelated
 * comments — on the agent's own threads, on teammates' threads, @mentions — and
 * the worse failure mode is **over-responding** (a chatty bot on every thread).
 * So the rules are a short list of hard rules, then a conservative soft zone.
 *
 * ## Ownership is consumed as INPUT (the task 3.1 seam)
 *
 * Rules 4 and 5 branch on the item's {@link OwnershipClass}, but the
 * `classifyOwnership` primitive that derives it is built later (task 3.1, §7).
 * This module therefore takes the ownership class as an **injected input** on
 * {@link CommentDecisionContext.ownership} — exactly like the dispatch policy
 * (`dispatch.ts`) takes `classifyOwnership` as a callback. Task 3.1 supplies the
 * real classification; tests inject a class directly. This module never
 * classifies ownership itself.
 *
 * ## The rules, in precedence order
 *
 * 1. **Never answer its own comments** — `author == identity.agent`, OR the body
 *    carries `identity.marker`. In shared-account mode the marker is the *only*
 *    signal. Highest precedence: it breaks self-reply loops before any other
 *    rule can fire. → `ignore`.
 * 2. **Always respond when directly addressed** — an @mention of the agent
 *    account, or an explicit `/flow` / `@flow` token in the body. **Overrides
 *    ownership** — even on a teammate's (`other`-owned) thread. → `respond`.
 * 3. **Resume an `agent/needs-input` item on a non-agent comment** — that reply
 *    is the answer the agent parked for via `needsInput`. → `resume`.
 * 4. **Stay out of `other`-owned threads unless mentioned** — rule 2 already
 *    handled the mention case, so here an `other`-owned thread is left alone.
 *    → `ignore`.
 * 5. **Soft zone leans quiet** — anything left (the agent's own / unassigned /
 *    reviewer threads with no direct address and no parked question) is the
 *    ambiguous middle. With `comments.ambiguousBias: "quiet"` (the default) the
 *    safe default is silence; `"engage"` flips it to respond. Over-responding is
 *    the worse failure, so quiet is the ship default.
 *
 * **This module is the pinned oracle**, mirroring the prose rules the v1
 * `linear-adapter` skill documents (`getInbox` shape) and the P5 promotion
 * surface. `comments.respondWhen` and `comments.ambiguousBias` drive the soft
 * zone so re-tuning chattiness is a config edit, never a code change.
 *
 * @see specs/unified-workflow-system/02-specification.md §5 (comment-response)
 * @see .agents/flow/skills/linear-adapter/SKILL.md (`getInbox` shape, the 5 rules)
 * @module @dorkos/flow/comment-response
