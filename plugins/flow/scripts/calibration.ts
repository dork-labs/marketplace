/**
 * The calibration ladder (§5) — the canonical, typed implementation of the
 * single most important behavior in the `/flow` engine: **uncertainty-gated
 * (not stage-gated) human involvement**.
 *
 * At every decision point the agent walks this five-row ladder top-down and
 * acts on the **first matching row**. Only three behaviors exist
 * ({@link InvolvementBehavior}); the only things that ever block the autonomous
 * loop are the floor (row 0), sticky uncertainty (row 2), and uncertainty in an
 * intent stage (row 3 routed to `ask`).
 *
 * | # | Condition | Behavior | Blocks loop? |
 * |---|-----------|----------|--------------|
 * | 0 | Floor — irreversible/destructive · outward-facing · secrets/spend/prod · scope change | stop-and-ask — even at full confidence | yes |
 * | 1 | Reversible + confident | proceed-silently | no |
 * | 2 | Sticky + not-confident | stop-and-ask | yes |
 * | 3 | Reversible + not-confident (the ambiguous middle) | routed by `stageBias` | stage-dependent |
 * | 4 | Sticky + confident | proceed-with-trail (announce) | no |
 *
 * Stage bias routes row 3 with the frozen spec as the cut line: intent stages
 * (CAPTURE/TRIAGE/IDEATE/SPECIFY → `intake`) ask; execution stages
 * (DECOMPOSE/EXECUTE/VERIFY → `execution`) proceed on the best default and log
 * the assumption. That single rule yields "IDEATE asks freely, EXECUTE asks
 * rarely" as an emergent property.
 *
 * **This module is the pinned oracle.** The v1 prose skills describe these same
 * rules in natural language, but this TypeScript is the tested source of truth
 * and the P5 promotion surface the spec is building toward — it is the library
 * core, not dead code. Every threshold is driven from the
 * {@link Calibration} config (`proceedSilentlyWhen`, `alwaysAsk`, `stageBias`,
 * `assumptionLog`) so re-tuning involvement never touches code.
 *
