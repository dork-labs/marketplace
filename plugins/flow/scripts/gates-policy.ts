/**
 * The four **hard gates** (§5) and the **auto-merge recovery ladder** (§6) —
 * the `/flow` engine's typed, config-driven control over when the autonomous
 * loop pauses for a human and how an approved-but-stale PR is recovered at merge
 * time.
 *
 * ## The four hard gates
 *
 * 1. **Question / soft-escalation** (any stage, dynamic) — NOT modeled here as a
 *    separate predicate: it is the calibration ladder itself
 *    ({@link resolveInvolvement}, task 2.1). Every disposition in this module
 *    that involves a judgement call ("is this conflict mechanical or a real
 *    tradeoff?", "is this drift behavior-altering?") is routed THROUGH that
 *    ladder rather than re-deriving the stop-vs-proceed behavior.
 * 2. **Plan-approval gate** (after DECOMPOSE, before EXECUTE) — OFF by default
 *    (`gates.planApproval: false`, §7.4). {@link planApprovalRequired} is the
 *    predicate; when `false` the engine flows DECOMPOSE→EXECUTE automatically
 *    and surfaces plan assumptions at the human-review gate instead.
 * 3. **Human-review gate** (after VERIFY) — ALWAYS ON; it is not config-gated
 *    (there is no knob to disable it). It is the entry point to the auto-merge
 *    recovery ladder: PR + evidence → In Review → assign human → stop; on
 *    approval the engine runs {@link evaluateAutoMerge}.
 * 4. **Circuit breaker** — {@link tripsCircuitBreaker} stops + escalates when a
 *    unit exceeds `estimate × estimateMultiplier` wall-clock or the `tokenBudget`.
 *
 * ## The auto-merge recovery ladder (§6)
 *
 * Human approval authorizes exactly **one state**: this diff, green, cleanly
 * mergeable. If that state can't be reproduced automatically at merge time, the
 * agent does NOT merge — {@link evaluateAutoMerge} checks three preconditions in
 * order (mergeable? → CI green? → functionally unchanged?), and each failure is
 * routed through the calibration ladder to a typed {@link MergeDisposition}.
 *
 * ## This module is the pinned oracle, not dead code
 *
 * As with {@link resolveInvolvement} and the dispatch policy, the v1 prose stage
 * skills describe these same gate rules in natural language; this TypeScript is
 * the tested source of truth and the **P5 promotion surface** — when the server
 * build replaces the skill-driven loop, it calls these functions directly. Every
 * threshold is read from {@link GatesSchema} config so re-tuning a gate is a
 * config edit, never a code change.
 *
 * @see specs/unified-workflow-system/02-specification.md §5 (gates), §6 (recovery ladder), §7.4 (plan-approval default off)
 * @module @dorkos/flow/gates
