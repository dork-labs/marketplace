/**
 * Canonical Zod schema for `specs/<slug>/03-tasks.json` — the single source of
 * truth for task decomposition (§8) — plus the PM-agnostic **provenance block**
 * that replaces today's scalar `linear-issue:` frontmatter.
 *
 * ## Collapse the dual task system (the contract)
 *
 * `03-tasks.json` is **canonical**. The built-in Task API is a *projection* for
 * live display only — never a second source of truth. The active phase is
 * mirrored into the tracker as a checklist **generated from `03-tasks.json`,
 * never hand-edited**. Downstream tooling reads this schema to render that
 * projection; nothing writes task state anywhere but the decomposition file.
 *
 * ## The task→issue mapping lives here, and ONLY here
 *
 * Each task may carry optional {@link TaskSchema | `issue`} and `parentIssue`
 * fields — the *only* home for the task→issue mapping. A flat top-level
 * `issues: […]` list is explicitly **rejected** (`.strict()` on
 * {@link TasksFileSchema}): it would duplicate the task→issue map and
 * reintroduce drift.
 *
 * ## Sub-issue promotion is the rare exception
 *
 * A task is promotable to its own tracker sub-issue **only** when
 * `size ≥ decomposition.subIssueThreshold` (default `"xl"`); parent size does
 * not additionally gate. See {@link isPromotableToSubIssue}. The vast majority
 * of tasks stay checklist lines mirrored into the ticket.
 *
 * @see specs/unified-workflow-system/02-specification.md §8 (decomposition, provenance, link cardinality)
 * @see ./config-schema.ts {@link SubIssueThresholdSchema} (the size scale & default threshold)
 * @module @dorkos/flow/tasks-schema
