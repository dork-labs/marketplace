/**
 * The **normalized inbound event seam** (§4; charter B0/G9) — the one typed
 * currency every inbound signal the `/flow` engine reacts to is expressed in,
 * regardless of how it arrived. A poller and a webhook both produce the *same*
 * {@link TrackerEvent} stream, so the engine downstream **cannot tell which
 * transport produced an event** (the G9 interchangeability invariant, pinned by
 * `__tests__/transport.test.ts`).
 *
 * ## Events are TRIGGERS, not truth
 *
 * A {@link TrackerEvent} says "*something changed on this item*", never "*this is
 * the item's current state*". The consuming reconciler **re-reads the item's
 * current state via the adapter (the `PMClient`) before acting** — the event only
 * tells it *which* item to look at. Two properties keep that idempotent across a
 * redelivered or double-polled event:
 *
 * - **{@link TrackerEventBase.dedupeKey}** — a stable key (`kind:itemId:occurredAt`,
 *   see {@link trackerEventDedupeKey}) so a consumer drops a duplicate it already
 *   processed.
 * - **skip-self-authored** — a `comment.added` carrying the agent's own
 *   `identity.marker` is the agent's own write; the comment-response rules
 *   (`shouldRespondToComment`, rule 1) ignore it so the loop never reacts to
 *   itself.
 *
 * ## The variant set (v1)
 *
 * The union closes over six `kind`s. The existing {@link InboxComment} becomes the
 * payload of {@link CommentAddedEvent} (the `comment` field); each other variant
 * carries exactly the payload its branch acts on (a mentioned account, a
 * from/to state category, the new assignee). The transport layer
 * (`transport.ts`) maps a tracker's native inbox/webhook payload onto these; the
 * reconciler layer (`reconcilers.ts`) consumes them. No tracker-native field name
 * crosses this seam — the adapter owns that mapping.
 *
 * @see specs/flow-triage-feeds-loop/02-specification.md §4 (the inbound event seam)
 * @see ./transport.ts (the `InboundTransport` / `PollingTransport` producers — task 4.2)
 * @see ./comment-response.ts ({@link InboxComment} — the `comment.added` payload)
 * @module @dorkos/flow/events
