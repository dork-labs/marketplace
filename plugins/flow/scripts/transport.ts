/**
 * The **inbound transport seam** (§4; charter B0/G9) — the producer side of the
 * normalized event seam. An {@link InboundTransport} turns a tracker's native
 * inbound signal (a polled inbox, or a pushed webhook) into a stream of
 * {@link TrackerEvent}s. The engine programs against the *interface*, never a
 * concrete producer, so swapping poll → webhook is a config edit
 * (`ingestion.producer`, task 4.4), not a code change — and the consuming
 * reconciler **cannot tell which transport produced an event** (the G9
 * interchangeability invariant, `__tests__/transport.test.ts`).
 *
 * ## v1 ships poll only; webhook is a deferred drop-in
 *
 * {@link PollingTransport} is the v1 producer. The webhook producer is a future
 * drop-in implementing this **same** interface (per the Non-Goals — NOT built
 * here). Because both emit the identical {@link TrackerEvent} envelope, neither
 * the reducer nor any reconciler changes when the webhook lands.
 *
 * ## Package purity — the injected fetch seam
 *
 * `@dorkos/flow` is pure (no fs / network). {@link PollingTransport} therefore
 * does **not** call the tracker itself: it wraps an **injected reader**
 * ({@link InboxReader}) the adapter supplies (the impure `getInbox` lives in the
 * agent/adapter layer, outside this package), plus a durable {@link Watermark}
 * cursor. Everything {@link PollingTransport} does — filter by the watermark, map
 * each entry onto a {@link TrackerEvent}, advance the cursor — is pure
 * transformation. This mirrors the Phase 3 `FlowStateStore` seam: the I/O is
 * injected, the decision logic is pure and server-portable.
 *
 * @see specs/flow-triage-feeds-loop/02-specification.md §4 (the inbound event seam)
 * @see ./events.ts ({@link TrackerEvent} — the seam's currency — task 4.1)
 * @see .agents/flow/skills/linear-adapter/SKILL.md (`getInbox` — the reader the adapter supplies)
 * @module @dorkos/flow/transport
